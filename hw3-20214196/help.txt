In doing this assignment, I mostly refer to the assignment handout and the PyTorch documentation website to implement various modules.

I refer to the official PyTorch documentation of various build-in functions such as torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy, torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity, torch.mm, torch.gather, and torch.scatter.

Due to inability to update the CUDA driver on my lab GPU server from 10.2 to 11.1, I decided to train the network using cudatoolkit=10.2 instead of cudatoolkit=11.1.

Also, since the self-supervised training only supports single-GPU usage and my GPU cannot fit the default batch size in most models (except SimSiam), I decided to train the network with a maximum batch size of 256 on almost every model (except MoCo, which fits only for batch size of 128).

Fixing batch size of 64 leads to an assertion error during the validation, so I decided not to include the result in the report.pdf file.

Thank you for conducting this course throughout the semester. It's been fun to learn this course throughout the semester.
